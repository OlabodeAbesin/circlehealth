# Circle Link Health

Build a Laravel application which will be used by nurses to input their patientsâ€™ blood pressure readings. 

**The application should have below features**

- [x] A page for creating patients
- [X] A page to record blood pressure readings for patients
- [x] Export a CSV of all patients 

**Dev requirements**

- [x] Use Laravel Excel to generate CSV
- [x] Use Livewire Datatables
- [x] Use tailwind css
- [x] Write tests
- [x] Use Alpine/Livewire, not Vue.js or anything else
- [x] Create a seeder that seeds the DB with 50000 patients. We will run this seeder when evaluating your project. The app and CSV export should work with 50000 patients.
